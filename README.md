# Connectine
Connectine is a web application that is intended for users to connect during national quarantine (hence the name). It's meant to be a light-hearted, easy way to make small talk, or meet someone new through a shared interest, something you may be used to prior to quarantine. 




# Deployment
This project still has a few critical bugs that must be solved prior to deploying it online permanently.
